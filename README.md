# Spotify Playlist Generator

This program is a web application which takes in a user's preferred genre of music and the length of time of the playlist and randomly generates a Spotify playlist based on Spotify's library of songs and recommendations. The user then has the option to start over and make a new playlist or add the playlist to their Spotify account subsequently. The web application makes use of the Spotipy API, a library which allows the use of Spotify's basic recommendation tools and functions in Python/Flask.

Install Pandas

pip install pandas
